Properties to prove:


[1] Stop motor (SW) is unreachable if (the DC motor process is never scheduled OR user 
    input does not produce a subsequent OFF).

[2] In Interface, either the ON or the OFF path is taken is always taken if the current 
    input is !previous input.

[3] If the input always produces an ON, then stop motor (motor process) is only reachable 
    if either the RPM OR Temp threshold has been exceeded. 

[4] The motor (motor process) will never stop if the report RPM OR temp interleaving is never scheduled.

[5] If dc power (DC process) is never supplied to the motor and the input is always ON, the SW process can 
    never reach the stop motor state.

[6] If report RPM OR report temp interleavings (motor process) do not report status, and user input is always ON, the motor never stops and the stop motor (motor process)
    is unreachable.
